5.2 	Section of a frieze on the sides of a platform at the site of Animas Altas, a predominantly Paracas phase 9 site located in the Callango Basin of the lower Ica Valley. Sarah Massey first located and described this frieze: this drawing is based on her 1981 sketch, her dissertation and a published description (Massey 1991, figure 8.4).
5.3 	Three styles of narrow bands, woven in variants of a triple-cloth structure, with reported provenience in or around the Ocucaje basin, Ica Valley. Bands TM 91.878 and 879 are reported to be from the same burial. TM 91.855, 91.878, 91.879. 
5.4 	Ceramic mask allegedly excavated in the site of Chongos in the Pisco valley. The nose-like central flange protrudes 11 cm above the domed surface. A series of perforations along the rim of the mask would facilitate its attachment to a costume or mortuary bundle. BMA 64.94.
5.5 	Close-knotted band from the Arena Blanca sector of the Paracas site, and close-knotted panels separated by regularly spaced sections of unknotted yarns to form an openwork fabric typical of hammock-shaped hairnets found in both Cavernas and Necropolis tombs. TM 1961.37.1B, 91.1066.
5.6 	Close-knotted panel with drawstrings at one end; the other end, now incomplete, probably had a similar arrangement, creating a hammock-shaped wrap. Fabricated with much heavier yarns than analogous objects known from the Paracas site, this knotted “headdress” seems too bulky to have been worn in life. It is alleged to be part of an Ocucaje gravelot transitional from Phase 10 to early Nasca 1. TM 91.935.
5.7 	Probably a headcloth, this cotton fabric combines plain weave, in some places with discontinuous wefts creating a pattern of short slits, with areas where pairs of warps are crossed before wefts are inserted to create an openwork image of the rayed head. The embroidery is in a distinctive technique that uses diagonal stitching in both figure and ground areas to create Broad Line images. TM 91.1009.
5.8 	Fragments of an embroidered border from a small mantle or possibly a headcloth, found among the textiles packed close to the body in Paracas Necropolis burial 352 and catalogued as specimen 115. MRI DB-7.

5.16 	Embroidered borders in Ocucaje 9 and 10 styles, executed in dyed camelid hair on a tightly woven, slightly warp-faced cotton base cloth. TM 91.1032, TM 91.901.
5.17 	Mantle with full figures embroidered on the borders in the Ocucaje 10 style, with the addition of large rayed head figures in different yarn weight, dyes and stitching in the central area of the plain-weave panel. This textile is ascribed to a Nasca 1 burial at Ocucaje. TM 91.906.
5.18 	Paracas Necropolis Burial 420, specimen 3. This very early Block Color embroidery, a detail of a rectangular tab hanging down the back of a shoulder poncho, shares design features with Broad Line, Linear and early Nasca embroideries. It is worked on a woven panel, with a simple contrasting fringe. MNAAHP RT2999.
5.19 	Paracas Necropolis burial 243, specimen 7. This early Block Color style embroidered mantle border depicts a human wearing a sheet gold forehead ornament, mouthmask, and disks attached to a headband and carrying a knife and human head tassel. The rayed headdress incorporates the tail of a “goatsucker” figure. This image is repeated on a matching shoulder poncho. MNAAHP RT3173.
5.20 	Paracas Necropolis gravelot 420 specimen 2. This detail from a complex figure shows a human-bird figure that tips a long appendage that emerges like a tongue from the mouthmask of the main figure. This secondary figure in turn has a mouth appendage ending in a feline, holds a sling or necklace in one hand and a forehead ornament in the other, with a rayed head in the position of a headdress ornament. MNAAHP RT5907. 
5.21 	Paracas Necropolis burial 421, specimen 44. Detail of the neck of a shoulder poncho (esclavina) with borders and bands depicting interlinking bands attached to rayed heads. Felines are set into the triangular interstice. Note the tiny rayed motifs in the sub-border. MNAAHP RT205.
5.22 	Paracas Necropolis gravelot 310 specimen 39 and MNAAHP gravelot 378 specimen 7. Examples of rayed head figures on a headcloth and mantle from two related gravelots from the Wari Kayan cemetery (Paracas Necropolis) demonstrate similarities and differences on the levels of garment design, figure style and iconography. MNAAHP RT1003, RT2673.
5.23 	Border fragment combining several different figures, including one with a mask-like rayed head, embroidered using techniques, design principles and a range of colors characteristic of early Nasca. AMNH 41.2 714.
5.24 	Mantle combining an image similar to late objects from Paracas Necropolis gravelots on the central band, imagery and design features associated with contemporary objects of Nasca Valley provenience on the lateral borders, and a repetition of rayed head images across the central ground. AMNH 41.0 1501.
5.25 	Headcloth with rayed head motifs worked in camelid hair using a warp wrapping technique during the weaving of the fine cotton cloth of the central panel. A separately constructed border carries designs constructed in complex looping over separately woven cotton plain weave tapes and knotted extensions. Small embroidered motifs resembling hummingbirds with looped elements span the join between the borders and the central panel. BMA 38.121.
5.26 	Early Nasca bottle featuring an “oculate rayed head” image, with ringed eyes and mouth, eight straight (star-like) rays and eight hooked rays. MRI 2926.
5.27 	Lower panel of a tunic excavated in a group of offering and burial pits set into an anthropogenic mound at the site of San Miguel de Azapa. The slit tapestry panel was woven on paired white warps that had been scaffolded onto the loomstring end of a previously woven warp-striped tunic. MASMA.

7.1	Map of the smaller part of Lake Titicaca and surrounding areas showing the location of the island of Pariti and the Tiahuanaco site.
7.2	View of the present-day community of Pariti (facing north-northwest). The offering pits, Features 1 and 2, were discovered near the northwest corner of the football field. The excavation is visible in the center of the photo.
7.3	Ceramics in situ in Pariti’s Feature 2, at a depth of c. 205 cm.
7.4	This fragmentary gold ornament depicting a Profile Attendant (height 2.3 cm) was recovered near the base of Pariti’s Feature 2.
7.5	Plan of the 32 m2 area excavated in 2004–2006 by our Finnish-Bolivian team, locating Pariti’s Features 1 and 2 in relation to walls or wall foundations associated with two Tiwanaku Period building phases, perhaps representing a temple. In the northern extreme are capstones covering two (Post-Tiwanaku?) canals.
7.6	Kero PRT 00475 (height 14.2 cm). Six trophy head motifs circle the vessel’s slightly protruding exterior torus. The kero’s body displays two profile felines separated by steps ending in avian heads. Atypically, the felines’ heads are depicted frontally.
7.7	Keros PRT 00216 (on the left; height 13.3 cm) and 00161 (on the right; height 13.4 cm). The vessel on the left features three design registers, the upper and lower of which display four trophy head motifs each. The kero on the right has a triple torus and the vessel’s upper register displays five trophy heads.
7.8	Ch’allador PRT 00278 (height 27.6 cm) displays a rattlesnake which coils around the vessel 12 times. The serpent’s modeled head peers over the rim of the vessel.
7.9	Ch’alladores PRT 00110 (on the left; height 24.5 cm) and 00111 (on the right; height 24.5 cm). The vessel on the left has crosswise tubes in its interior and displays both internal and external decoration. The interior of the “typical” ch’allador on the right is very richly decorated, whereas the decoration of its exterior surface is quite sparse.
7.10	Paired ch’alladores PRT 00508 (on the left; height 25.5 cm) and 00260 (on the right; height 24.3 cm). The vessels’ exterior features three design registers, all displaying feline motifs. A thin wavy line in black circles both vessels’ interior rim. Interestingly, the sherds of the ch’allador PRT 00260 were recovered in Pariti’s Feature 1, those of its pair in Feature 2.
7.11	The interior of the tazon PRT 00463 (rim diameter 14.2 cm) displays three inverted avian heads close to the rim and two horizontal bands lower down. The vessel’s exterior is undecorated.
7.12	The exterior of the small escudilla PRT 00453 (rim diameter 12.0 cm) is undecorated, while the interior of its narrow flaring rim displays four profile feline heads separated by zones of vertical bands in orange, black, and white.
7.13	Large escudilla PRT 00115 (rim diameter 28.5 cm). The interior of the vessel’s flaring rim displays five profile felines separated by steps ending in avian heads. The exterior, on the other hand, displays three larger profile felines.
7.14	Large escudilla PRT 00499 (rim diameter 25.6 cm). The vessel’s exterior is undecorated, whereas the interior of its flaring rim displays atypical decoration. This escudilla has a “pouring lip” (visible on the left), apparently very rare in Tiwanaku ceramics.
7.15	Pedestal bowl PRT 00525 (rim diameter 16.9 cm). The vessel’s exterior body displays six, and the pedestal two additional, trophy heads.
7.16	The pedestal of the vessel PRT 00529 (rim diameter 30.6 cm) is a portrait head. A modeled feline peers over the rim of the vessel.
7.17	The sahumador PRT 00539 (rim diameter 18.8 cm) displays only exterior decoration: a band of step motifs below the rim, above the vessel’s two opposing, vertical handles. This is one of the 19 vessels whose sherds were deposited both in Feature 1 and in Feature 2.
7.18	The tinaja PRT 00310 (height 36.8 cm) has a pair of opposing, vertical body handles. On the shoulders are four repeats of a design consisting of an avian head and several step motifs.
7.19	Blackware beakers PRT 00262 (on the left; height 17.5 cm) and 00173 (on the right). The base of the vessel on the left seems to represent a right foot, that of its “near-pair” a left foot. Thirteen incised trophy head motifs circle the exterior rim of the better-preserved beaker.
7.20	Three so-called kidney-shaped bowls. The vessel in the background (PRT 00190; maximum rim diameter 21.7 cm) is of the larger variant with a rounded base. The smaller vessel on the left in the foreground (PRT 00107; maximum rim diameter 15.8 cm) has a rather flat base, the small bowl on the right (PRT 00189; maximum rim diameter 11.0 cm) a slightly projecting ring base.
7.21	Three female effigy vessels: PRT 00268 (on the left; height 15.2 cm), 00184 (in the middle; height 20.4 cm), and 00181 (on the right; height 14.4 cm). Note the careful manner in which the clothing worn by each woman is depicted.
7.22	Male effigy vessels PRT 00074 (on the left; height 20.5 cm) and 00166 (on the right; height 21.0 cm). Both men have long sideburns and wear a labret in the upper lip and a collar or necklace. The curious four-pointed base of the vessel on the right may represent a fruit.
7.23	Portrait vessels PRT 00316 (on the left; height 26.8 cm) and 00075 (on the right; height 12.5 cm). Both portray males with short hair, who wear large ear plugs and a labret in the lower lip. The male of the larger portrait vessel also wears a curious necklace/collar.
7.24	The kero PRT 00154 (height 23.1 cm) displays a partially modeled Staff God image.
7.25	Staff God image decorating the kero PRT 00154. Redrawn from an original drawing by Juan Villanueva.

7.28	The kero PRT 00235 (height 25.0 cm) displays a Rayed Head whose crown contains 14 appendages: a tripartite tuft both at top center and at bottom center, a feline head at each of the 4 corners, 4 avian heads, and 4 circled dots.
7.29	The kero PRT 00482 (height 23.4 cm) features a Rayed Head which rests on a stepped platform. The modeled face displays tear bands ending in avian heads and is encircled by a band containing interlocking frets. The 16 crown appendages include a tripartite tuft both at top center and at bottom center, a feline head at each of the 4 corners, 2 avian heads, and 8 circled dots.

15.1	Tiahuanaco, Huari, and their Middle Horizon spheres of influence. The map shows the overlap of the two spheres, as well as each capital, important secondary sites, and key geographical areas (in bold text) (Drawn by William H. Isbell).
15.2	The Ayacucho Valley locating Huari, Conchopata, and other heartland settlements of late Huarpa and Wari cultures (Drawn by William H. Isbell).
15.3	Probable dates for events discussed in text, plotted against currently popular chronologies for Tiahuanaco and Huari. Dates are intended to represent calibrated years (but not southern hemisphere corrected). As stated in the chapter text, the date of cal. A.D. 500 seems too early for the onset of the Tiwanaku Period at Tiahuanaco; A.D. 650-700 seems more likely, at least for the radical changes in ceramics that brought in new vessel forms decorated with new polychrome design themes, as well as the appearance of SAIS style stone sculptures (Drawn by William H. Isbell).
15.4	Gate of the Sun, Tiahuanaco, showing all the icons sculpted on its front side (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.5	Gate of the Sun, Tiahuanaco, detail, emphasizing the late SAIS iconic triad. The Staff God appears in the center, larger than other images, and standing of a pyramidal pedestal. To his left and right are three rows of Profile Attendants, two with human and one with avian faces. At the bottom of the sculpted register are Rayed Heads, within a meander band, and each placed on a low pyramid pedestal (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.6 	Kantataita Lintel, Tiahuanaco. Seriated as the earliest of the SAIS sculptures, that all belong to the Tiwanaku Phase at Tiahuanaco. The lintel’s severely damaged images are prototypical Profile Attendants. However, their formal attributes are consistent with sacrificers of early SAIS art. The reconstructive drawing was prepared by Isbell and Cook (1987) from rubbings taken from the stone, but many details remain in question because of the extensive damage (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.7 	The Linares Lintel is considered stylistically slightly later than the Kantataita Lintel. It depicts two of the late SAIS pantheon images, Staff God and Profile Attendants, although the attendants' formal attributes still relate very much to the early SAIS Sacrificer, and the incomplete Staff God figure might be intermediate between the Rayed Head and the Staff God. The photograph and upper reconstructive drawing were published by Arthur Posnansky (adapted from Posnansky 1945, Figs. 140 and 140a). The lower reconstruction was drawn by Patricia Knobloch (published with her permission) based on the Posnansky photograph and her knowledge of Tiwanaku-style art. The decision to hypothetically represent a complete but diminutive body with feet expresses her evaluation that there was sufficient space on the narrow lintel-stone to include these elements (see http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~bharley/images/WWWMINDICON2011and2.jpg). If Knobloch is correct the lintel’s imagery anticipated the SAIS Staff God more than if the body were only partial, and consequently, more of an intermediate between Rayed Head and Staff God. However, there seems little doubt that this imagery reveals a step toward the Late SAIS pantheon so prominent in both Wari and Tiwanaku, but only two of the three supernaturals are present, the Staff God and Profile Attendants.
15.8 	Sculpture from Tiahuanaco that precedes Late SAIS imagery, and belongs to the Yaya-Mama style, defined by Karen and Sergio Chávez. The Rayed Head was popular in at least some Yaya-Mama representations, appearing in the most elaborate form of Yaya-Mama art, the Pucara style, in which a distinctive Sacrificer figure has been described as the “feline man” (Sergio Chávez, this volume, 2002). This Yaya-Mama statue was named the "Bearded Statue" by its discoverers, but comparison with other Andean imagery shows that it is actually wearing a large nose ring or mouth mask similar to many that appear in Nasca art (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.9 	The Ponce Monolith, named for Bolivian archaeologist Carlos Ponce S. was discovered at Tiahuanaco by his excavation team, in fill near the center of the Kalasasaya mound, where it was probably interred by 17th century extirpators of idolatries. It is assigned to the third phase of late SAIS iconography at Tiahuanaco by Agüero, Uribe and Berenguer (2003), and it is the stylistically earliest monument to represent the entire Late SAIS triad, Staff God, Profile Attendants, and Rayed Head. This photo, taken by W. H. Isbell in 1964, shows the statue in the excavation pit where it was discovered (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.10 	The Ponce Monolith was eventually placed upright near the center of Kalasasaya platform, facing east. The body is represented as clad in elaborately decorated garments that are replete with SAIS imagery ‒ Staff God, Profile Attendants, and Rayed Heads – as well as other symbols (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.11 	This reconstructive drawing of the imagery carved on the surface of the Ponce Monolith was prepared by Amy Oakland, from rubbings and photographs (Published with her permission). It shows the statue opened from the middle of the front to highlight the Staff God on the upper back, just below the snake-like bands that apparently represent the figure's braided hair. This is the stylistically earliest appearance of the SAIS triad at Tiahuanaco, and shows a Staff God on the back, and another on the headband, over the nose. Profile Attendants, now bereft of Sacrificer attributes, appear on the body, facing toward or away from the Staff God, and on the headband, marching toward the central Staff God from its right and left. Rayed Heads appear on the belt.
15.12 	The architrave popularly called the Gate of the Moon is assigned to Phase 5, the end of the Late SAIS stylistic seriation at Tiahuanaco, by Agüero, Uribe and Berenguer (2003). Other Phase 5 sculptures are the famous Gate of the Sun and the Llojeta Block. (Photo by William H. Isbell)
15.13 	The painted Staff God from a giant jar discovered at Conchopata in 1977, with a reconstructive drawing of the image drawn by Patricia Knobloch. This version of the deity icon is most similar to the Staff God carved on the Ponce Monolith. The two must have been drafted from the same model and should therefore belong to the same time period. They synchronize Tiwanaku stylistic development with Wari stylistic chronology (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.14 	Although crafted in different media, Staff Gods from the back of the Ponce Monolith and from the chest of the 1977 Conchopata effigy offering jars are remarkably similar in many details (Drawings by Patricia Knobloch and William H. Isbell).
 15.15 	The Conchopata map shows the probable early MH residence consisting of rooms EA-204, EA-205, EA-206, and patio EA-208, in the southwestern sector of the site, next to the Quebrada de Totorilla. A settlement center seems to have been established between BC-A and BC-B, and perhaps also BC-C and BC-D, that was covered by layers of sand that, in the evening sunlight, take on a pinkish cast, and therefore the space was named the Pink Plaza. This apparently public space was the site of offerings placed in pits excavated though the distinctive sand surfacing, including one discovered in 1977, and another discovered in 2000. Circular and "D"-shaped buildings, probably temples, contrast with large orthogonal enclosures surrounded by elongated galleries (patio groups) and smaller, agglutinated rectangular rooms. 
15.16 	This giant jar from Conchopata EA-208 is missing its human face-lug, located just below the shoulder of the vessel, and from which two stylized arms spread horizontally, to turn down at the elbows, creating the effigy of a person with decorated chest. On stylistic grounds the vessel is best dated Middle Horizon 1a or early 1b (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.17 	This giant jar from Conchopata EA-208, is also missing its human face-lug located just below the shoulder of the vessel, from which stylized arms spread horizontally, and turn down at the elbows, to define a human chest. On stylistic grounds the vessel is best dated Middle Horizon 1a or early 1b, although decoration on the neck is consistent with Huarpa ceramic painting, and the orange background color of this vessel identifies it as belonging to the Ocros style (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.18 	This fancy Chakipampa style giant jar from Conchopata EA-205 includes the human face-lug that helps transform the vessel body into a person's chest. The pair of arches from the top of the head probably indicates female gender. On stylistic grounds the vessel is best dated Middle Horizon 1a or early 1b (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.19 	This regular Chakipampa style giant jar from Conchopata EA-205 has a painted face with hastily decorated rectangular panel that probably represents a simplified human effigy like those outlined on other giant jars from EA-205 and 208 (Figures 16, 17, and 18). It also dates from Middle Horizon 1a or early 1b (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.20 	This bowl from Ayacucho is decorated with the triple recurved ray motif (A, above), and the banded rectangle motif (B, below), probably derived from Nasca’s Humped Animal or Monkey theme (Knobloch 2005:133, Fig. 11). The two motifs appear early in Ayacucho’s Chakipampa pottery style and serve as excellent diagnostics of Middle Horizon Epoch 1a and early 1b (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.21 	Two views of a fancy Chakipampa giant jar from ceramic offering 2000b, excavated at Conchopata. This vessel represents the first of two modes for face neck human effigy jars found in the 2000b smashed offering. It is best dated as stylistically later than the jars from EA-205 and EA-208, and is assigned to Middle Horizon 1b, probably between A.D. 750 and 775. However, these ceramics predate the appearance of SAIS iconography at Conchopata (see Haeberli’s discussion of the “Incursion,” this volume) (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.22 	Two views of a giant vessel representing the second of two modes for face neck human effigy jars found in the 2000b smashed offering at Conchopata. This mode depicts the “Super Pajaro” theme. The offering is best dated MH Epoch 1b, stylistically later than the jars from EA-205 and EA-208, but prior to the appearance of SAIS iconography at Conchopata (see Haeberli’s discussion of the “Incursion,” this volume). The yellow or orange background color means that that this jar should be assigned to Menzel’s Ocros style (Photo by William H. Isbell).
.15.23 	This variant of the fancy Chakipampa giant face neck jar from ceramic offering 2000b differs from the other examples in having a diagonally placed banded rectangle design on its cheek, and a divergent white dot and recurved rays design between the stylized hands (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.24 	Two decorated sherds included in the 1977 offering are consistent with design details on vessels from the 2000b offering, located only about 5.5 meters away, and cut through Conchopata's Pink Plaza (Compare with Figure 15.21.) Inclusion of sherds surely from the 2000b offering vessels means that these fragments were probably littering the ceremonial area when the 1977 offering was interred. Although probably close in time, the 2000b offering must be older than the 1977 offering (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.25 	The 1977 Conchopata ceramic offering included giant jars decorated in two distinct modes. The less popular mode, depicted here, is related to the Nasca-Ayacucho tradition. It depicts a ventrally extended mythical being with severed heads and squared-off recurved ray designs (Photo by William H. Isbell).  
15.26 	The less popular mode of 1977 offering jars from Conchopata also depict a half-circle, or "D"-shaped figure with columns of circled white dots inside (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.27 	Decoration on the popular mode of 1977 offering jars from Conchopata depicts SAIS iconography, although not exclusively. As shown in the reconstruction drawn in the upper left hand corner, the jars are face neck human effigies, each representing a male wearing a tunic decorated on the torso area with a Staff God who has two rows of smaller Profile Attendants to his right and left. The upper row of attendants faces away from, and the lower row faces toward the Staff God (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.28 	Details of the Staff God, its pyramidal pedestal, and Profile Attendants from a 1977 offering jar (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.29 	Variations among the face necks of male effigies on the 1977 offering jars includes clean faces as well as faces with beard and mustache (15.27). Also appearing are faces with cheek and nose paint, sometimes with and sometimes without beard and mustache (15.31). Variations among the shoulder design, where a tunic neck slit is clearly indicated, include dual felines with peg teeth and tail curving up over the back, apparently of the Nasca-Ayacucho tradition (see also 15.27) (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.30 	This shoulder of a 1977 offering jar shows an alternative design theme for that area, a field of small humped animals, apparently of the Nasca-Ayacucho tradition (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.31 	A fragment of a face neck jar from the 1977 Conchopata offering shows the elaborately painted cheek decoration (unfortunately the nose, with its painted decoration, is broken off) that appears along with small beard and mustache. The shoulder area of the figure’s tunic is decorated with another alternative theme, checkered hands, apparently shown palm up (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.32 	Checkered hands from the shoulder section of 1977 giant offering jars (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.33 	The 1977 offering Staff God stands on a pyramidal pedestal with three steps. Inside the pedestal is a rectangular box containing a strange animal oriented horizontally. On the upper surface of the box are two projections with upward-facing feline heads and what may be stylized feathers emanate from the sides of the rectangle (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.34 	Details of the pyramidal pedestal on which the 1977 offering Staff God stands, showing the long-nosed head with toothy mouth and "N"-shaped canines who appears on the expanded and upturned lowest step of the pedestal (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.35 	Details of the pyramidal pedestal (far right) showing feline heads rising from the center box, as well as Staff God feet with circled dot in heel (in contrast to the more popular spiral in heel, see 15.13 and 15.28). Note that the background color of this sherd approximates the orange of the Ocros style more than the white characteristic of most sherds from the 1977 offering vessels. Other sherds show details of Profile Attendants from the 1977 Conchopata offering vessels (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.36 	Two rows of Profile Attendants accompanying the Staff God on the giant face neck jars from the Conchopata 1977 offering. This vessel background approximates the color of the Ocros style (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.37 	Reconstruction (Drawn by William H. Isbell) and details of a Profile Attendant from a giant face neck jar from the Conchopata 1977 offering. This detail shows that the upper row of Profile Attendants who face away from the Staff God met face to face (or staff to staff) at the back of the jar (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.38 	This lower procession of Profile Attendants facing towards the Staff God shows some of the variation occurring among the vessels, including the hands of different artists, but perhaps also the use of different paints and other materials (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.39 	Processions of Profile Attendants were painted continuously over the handles of the giant 1977 effigy jars (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.40 	Details of shoulder area decorated with the checkered hand motif, is located above the body section decorated with Profile Attendants, on a 1977 Conchopata offering jar.  A noticeable angle separates these two sections (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.41 	Sherds discovered in 2003 with Staff God image (D), almost identical to the 1977 offering Staff God, but Profile Attendants, although fragmentary, more consistent with southern SAIS imagery from Tiahuanaco and northern Chile (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.42 	Drawing of details of the 2003 Profile Attendant showing its N-shaped canines, a decorated chin band or bar, embedded limb bands, a short tufted ray at the mouth, what is apparently a belt, legs in the running or genuflecting position, a crown that consists of two bands, and a wing similar to those of Phase 3 (Agüero et al. 2003) sculptures from Tiahuanaco. This set of attributes combines features that range from Phase 1 through Phase 3 of the Agüero et al. seriation, as well as attributes best known in the snuff paraphernalia of northern Chile (Drawing by William H. Isbell).
15.43 	A single sherd from the 1977 Conchopata offering pit, is decorated with a Profile Attendant consistent with 2003 imagery. This shows that the 2003 jars belong with offering pottery smashed in the ceremonial area of Conchopata where the 1977 and 2000b offerings were discovered. The inclusion of this sherd also shows that the 2003 pottery is almost surely slightly earlier than the 1977 offering (Photo by William H. Isbell). 
15.44 	Conchopata 1942/1999 Staff God and Profile Attendants. First discovered by Julio C. Tello in 1942, Menzel (1964, 1977) restudied Tello's collection of deliberately smashed giant urns, constructing its inventory of images from fragments much less complete than this large sherd discovered in 1999. Menzel named this variant of Profile Attendant Angel A. She argued that this Staff God and its Profile Attendants represented the initial introduction of Tiahuanaco imagery into Ayacucho, initiating Middle Horizon Epoch 1a, and inspiring cultural changes that precipitated the Wari polity and its capital city. However, it is now clear that this style of Staff God and Profile Attendant is later than the SAIS iconography discussed above that decorates smashed jars, but that SAIS imagery is no older than Middle Horizon Epoch 1B. Furthermore, SAIS imagery appeared after the development of the Nasca-Wari, Chakipampa ceramic style, after the first ceremonial smashes of giant jars, and after the formation of Wari as an expansive political system governed from an urbanized heartland (Photo by William H. Isbell).
15.45 	Horizontal winged Profile Attendants, apparently flying, that have feline or human faces were named Angel C by Menzel (1964, 1977). They are part of the inventory of SAIS imagery associated with the 1942/1999 Conchopata offerings (Photo by William H. Isbell).  
15.46 	Winged horizontal Profile Attendants with avian faces were also classified as Angel C by Menzel (1964, 1977, and belong with the 1942/1999 Conchopata offerings. 
15.47 	Horizontal Profile Attendants with feline or human faces, lacking wings but with distinct projections from the back, were named Angel D by Menzel (1964, 1977). They also belong with the imagery of the 1942/1999 Conchopata offerings (Photo by William H. Isbell).  
15.48 	This giant Conchopata urn is decorated with disembodied mythical profile heads that probably derived from Profile Attendants. This icon is unique to the Conchopata/Huari sphere of late SAIS imagery. Furthermore, this urn has no Anadenanthera colubrina symbols (Photo by William H. Isbell).  
15.49 	This giant urn from Conchopata is decorated with variations of the disembodied mythical profile head, including feline/human faced, and avian faced heads.  Two Anadenanthera colubrina symbols appear in the crown each image, one in the top and one in the back. It seems significant that this urn, like some other religious art from Conchopata has numerous Anadenanthera colubrina symbols, while some objects (15.48) have few, or none at all.  Religion in the Huari sphere seems (as at Tiahuanaco) to have included two types of experiences, one more based on hallucinogenic trance characteristic of shamanism, and the other more sober and doctrinal in nature (Photos by William H. Isbell).  
15.50 	The eye of the avian-faced Profile Attendant on Tiahuanaco's Gate of the Sun has an Anadenanthera colubrina symbol attached. It is the only convincing Anadenanthera colubrina icon on the Gate of the Sun (Drawing by Patricia Knobloch).
15.51 	These details from the left upper portion of the Ponce Monolith are replete with Anadenanthera colubrina symbols, as is the entire statue, and many other Tiahuanaco religious sculptures. It seems likely that relative abundance of Anadenanthera colubrina imagery in Tiahuanaco (and Huari) religious art relates to the popularity of hallucinogen-induced, shamanic types of religious experiences among the patrons of that art. Scarcity of Anadenanthera colubrina imagery in religious art probably relates to preferences for more sober and doctrinal kinds of religious experiences. To the degree that this is true, it seems that Tiahuanaco (and Huari) enjoyed two distinct modes of religious experience, that were probably in conflict and negotiation, at least some of the time (Drawing by Amy Oakland, enlarged figures in red redrawn by William H. Isbell). 
15.52 	Anadenanthera colubrina symbols appear abundantly in the imagery on the Late SAIS Tiwanaku Phase 5 Taquiri Cube. Phase 5 in the Agüero et al. seriation (2003) also includes the Gate of the Sun – with its single location for A. colubrina, and the Llojeta Block, apparently lacking the symbol (Illustration based on Ryden 1947:357, figure 147).
16.1	a) An example of a Wari hybrid vessel from the Cañete Valley, Field Museum # 1588.170243. b) An example of a Wari hybrid vessel (Wari Norteño) from the San Jose site of the Lambayeque Valley (editor’s note: it seems likely that this vessel came from the site currently known as San Jose de Móro, that is actually located in the Jequetepeque Valley). Field Museum # 2959.171668. Such stylistic blending is widely apparent on Inka aribola in regions the Inka Empire controlled, but earlier Wari hybrids and stylistic variations are considered a material correlate of inter-polity exchange and interaction rather than political control. 
16.2	a) The Moquegua Valley is located in southern Peru (the area of probable Wari influence is shaded). b) The Moquegua Drainage is roughly divided into the Middle Valley, which is the area dominated by Tiwanaku settlements, and the steeper upper drainages, which are dominated by Wari-related sites. Nevertheless, each polity had colonial settlements in both areas and current evidence suggests that for at least some parts of the Middle Horizon, Wari and Tiwanku settlers in the upper drainages shared the use of the same irrigation system (Williams 2001; Williams and Nash 2002).
16.3	There is some evidence of exchange of ceramic vessels between Wari and Tiwanku colonists. a) This Wari cup was found in a burial from the Middle Valley Tiwanaku cemetery at Chen Chen (photo courtesy of Nicola Sherratt). b) A pottery fragment from the Wari patio group (Unit 9) on the summit of Cerro Baúl (photo courtesy of Ryan Williams).
16.4	The summit of Cerro Baúl is the location of the most monumental Wari site in the Moquegua Region. The map shows sectors A, B, and C (Williams 2001). The architecture at the site includes building forms identified at Huari, Pikillacta, and other Wari centers, such as Wari patio groups and D-shaped structures. Mapping and excavation reveal that the site is organized into several agglutinated complexes. A large compound on the eastern edge of the monumental core of the site has been identified as an elite residence or a provincial palace complex (see Moseley et al. 2005).
16.5	An elite residential compound or palace has been identified on the summit of Cerro Baúl in Sector A. The shaded areas were excavated over four field seasons from 2001 to 2007. The current map is an educated guess of wall placement in unexcavated areas. Unit 25 appears to have been an entrance hall, Unit 40A contains activities associated with ceramic production, 40B is not labeled and is a narrow corridor leading from Unit 25 to 41E. Unit 40C appears to have been a garden space because we found the stumps of three trees, which would never have grown on the summit of Cerro Baúl without human care. This space also lacked a floor of any kind. Unit 41A, 41B, and 41 C were small rooms built on descending terraces, all were accessed from the adjacent patio (41D), which was partially excavated, and 41 E appears to be a very large open space with evidence of ritual activity and productive activities such as lapidary work, the grinding of ceramic tempers and pigments, as well as weaving.
16.6	Examples of small face neck jars recovered from Cerro Baúl, both correspond to type 7 jars in form. Larger face neck jars have also been found in the brewery and palace, however the eyes are formed with narrow slits. To date, none of the face neck jars exhibit decorative motifs on the body, but they are limited to the face, headdress, and neck area.
16.7	Examples of four decorated cups and bowls recovered from the ritual abandonment smash in Unit 9, a Wari style patio group on the summit of Cerro Baúl. Museo Contisuyo #CB01-4045-top left, CB01-2563 top right, CB01-2570 bottom left, and CB01-4027 bottom right (photos courtesy of Ryan Williams). 
16.8	The plot of Unit 9 from Cerro Baúl shows the results of reconstructing smashed vessels from the patio space. Thus far over 60 vessels have been identified using an “MNI” approach, however not all 60 have been plotted because of the scattering of fragments of some vessels.
16.9	A preliminary typology of ceramic vessels from the patio of Unit 9 on Cerro Baúl. Bowls vary in form, however most have nubs and closely resemble examples from later LIP sites in the region. Type 1 jars are large with short necks and have a rim diameter of 30cm or more. Type 2 jars are medium in size, have short necks with rim diameters between 15 and 20 cm. Type 3 jars are small in size with short necks and a rim diameter of less than 14cm. Type 4 jars are large jars that have tall necks that flare at the rim. At present all examples are slipped red and the largest example has some decoration. Type 5 jars are similar to type 4, are smaller and flare only slightly at the rim. There are few examples of types 4 and 5 jars so the range for rim diameter has not yet been established. There is only one example of a type 6 jar. Type 7 jars exhibits a very fine compact paste (see figure 10) and flare less at the rim than Type 5 jars. The example illustrated here is a face neck jar showing faint eroded orange and white slip alternating in four panels along the rim.
16.10	This photo shows the only example of a type 8 jar. It exhibits a very compact paste, which is seen in some face neck jars, and many of the Loro style bowls found on Cerro Baúl. It has the same rim profile as a type 7 jar, however the neck is much longer and does not have a face
16.11	This bowl from the Unit 9 patio ceramic smash exhibits evidence of considerable use before it was included in the ritual deposit.

20.1 	Chronological chart illustrating the relative time frame for materials discussed in the text.
20.2 	Female “Occulate Being” with inverted “fetus” shown inside. The inverted position of the internal figure replicates the desired “presentation” for a baby about to be born. Repetion of the inverted form may have been a metaphor for successive generations, those yet to be born. Adapted and redrawn from Paul 1986.
20.3 	Color block figures from Paracas textiles: A) the larger figure with a smaller one carried on its back is outwardly of indeterminate sex but may represent a maternal image; B) the weapon-bearing, loin-cloth wearing figure is usually referred to as a warrior and assumed therefore to be male; C) the figure with a contorted upper body, severed head, and tumi knife has been referred to as a shaman, priest , or “sacrificer” and also assumed to be male.  All figures adapted and redrawn from photographs: A & B from Lumbreras, Lavalle, and Lang 1979a, C from British Museum registry #1954,05.563, colors approximate.
20.4 	Women in the Andes traditionally carry their infants and very young children in a backpack made from a textile as illustrated by the case of this Chilean woman. Picture by Emily Stovel.
20. 5 	5A) Siguas 1 textile fragment with definitively female image on the right side of the illustration. Photo courtesy of J. Haeberli. 5B) Images from the same textile fragment redrawn to demonstrate the representation of female genitalia. Symmetry of second figure (on the illustration’s left) is assumed, colors approximate.
20.6 	Late Nasca figurines showing women in birthing positions with body paint or tattoos on their abdomens. A) Seated figurine with small modeled breasts and a mythical ‘taster’ motif on the lower abdomen with the tongue emphasizing the location of the vaginal slit (after Proulx 2006: fig 5.146). B) An effigy jar showing the emerging face of the baby being born (drawn from photograph by Proulx 2006: plate 35, colors approximate).
20.7 	Examples of designs painted on late Nasca figurines. These motifs appear on the abdomen and/or across the back or buttocks of nude Nasca female figurines shown in the process of giving birth. They may represent supernatural beings invoked to protect mothers from attack by supernatural forces during or after childbirth. Other examples of these markings can be seen in Figure 6.
20.8 	Images of mythical mothers from the Wari site of Conchopata. A) Image painted on an urn showing a female figure with camelid attributes suckling a young feline (adapted and redrawn from Isbell and Cook 2002). B) Image from a second urn depicting two female figures feeding human body parts to a pack of hungry canines and birds (adapted and redrawn from Cook 2004).
20.9 	Drawing of a Wari tapestry fragment from Peru’s Museo Nacional with an anthropomorphic version of Sawyer’s ‘composite motif’. The raised arms and curled lower limbs are suggestive of a squatting pose, often used in childbirth. The mirror reflection of the figure, one head-up, the other head-down, creates an image of the figure giving birth to itself. Drawn from photograph of registry #2329, colors approximate.
20.10 	Coastal Wari figurine, Huara style, from the Arthur M. Sackler collection, accession # N-94. Katz describes the figure as an anthropomorphic feline, but the human-like arms, legs, and face suggest that the figure is intended to represent a person. The zigzag line on the front panel may represent the flow of menstrual blood, marking the figure as female. Drawn from photograph (Katz 1983: plate 158), colors approximate.
20.11 	Decoration on Tumilaca kero, on display in the Museo Contisuyu, Moquegua. It depicts an anthropomorphic being with curled lower limbs similar to those on the Wari tapestry fragment in Figure 9, arguably an abstract representation of the “partuition pose”. Accompanying geometric motifs such as the crosses with circle-dot centers and the Z-shaped meander may have imparted additional meaning to the original audience. Drawn from photograph (Goldstein and Rivera 2004), colors approximate.
20.12 	Drawing of a pair of spouted effigy vessels from Tiwanaku site of Pariti. The broad collars, blunt haircuts, and labretted upper lips make them very different from other representations of Tiwanaku people in the Lake Titicaca Basin, suggesting they represent members of a different ethnic group.  Ceramic material, red slip paint, and careful sculpting of the faces mark these as Tiwanaku pieces.  Discovered as a pair, they were described as a man (A) and a ‘fat man’ (B). Long hair visible falling down the back of the second figure, bracelets, anklets, and the different stance, however, make it reasonable to ‘read’ the second figure as female who is pregnant, not fat.  Based on photos by A. Korpisaari (Korpisaari and Parssinen 2005: photos 10 and 11). Colors approximate.
20.13 	Drawing of an anthropomorphic camelid birthing a human infant from a ch’allador found at Pariti. Reminiscent of the pooled blood on the Siguas textile in Figure 5, and the zigzag lines of blood illustrated on the figurine in Figure 10, blood (and/or amniotic fluid, or placental matter) flow down from between the camelid-mother’s squatting, anthropomorphic legs. Based on a photo by A. Korpisaari (Korpisaari and Parssinen 2005: photo 40). Color approximate.
20.14	Anthropomorphic images from Pignasi, Bolivia. A and B depict female figures in long dresses accompanied by a camelid and canine. C also appears to be wearing a long dress. Figure D, though of ambiguous sex is spatially associated with another camelid-like animal as part of the same panel as figures A and C. Adapted and redrawn from Cruz (2006). Color approximate.
20.15	The Pucara Camelid Woman theme is the quintessential representation of the association between females and domesticated camelids and seems to anticipate Colonial era accounts of puna-bound women herding their llamas and alpacas. Typically she leads a single llama with her left hand and holds a basket (of food? of wool?) and long staff. The divide eye may attest to her supernatural characteristics, or mark her as an important culture hero figure. Adapted and redrawn from Chavez 2002.
20.16 	Siguas I pyroengraved canes often depict rather abstract anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms. On this fragment the long necks of the animals allow us to recognize them as camelids. Two black-bodied birds are also shown. The one-eyed figure in the upper right corner appears to have a beak and could represent an anthropomorphic bird creature. Human figures in the Siguas tradition, however, often appear to wear elaborate headdresses or masks with rayed projections or horns, and this would appear to be such a case. While the level of abstraction makes it difficult to say much about this figure, it may represent a Siguas version of the “woman with camelid” theme. Adapted and redrawn from Haeberli 2002
20.17 	Textile from Ocoña, Peru is decorated in yellow and blue macaw feathers depicting two anthropomorphic beings with three camelids.  The animals appear to be domesticated as one is attached to the human figure by a leash. The human figures are of ambiguous sex but may represent women based on the association of women and domesticated camelids in SAIS iconography. Drawn from photo (Bonavia 1994: 211, plate 162). Colors approximate.
20.18 	Inca votive figurines like the one illustrated here have been found in a variety of offering contexts including high mountain capacocha human sacrifices, and offerings submerged in Lake Titicaca near the Islands of the Sun and Moon. This example was executed in gold, but other have been found made of both silver and spondylus shell. Drawn from photo of item on display at Museo Contisuyu, Moquegua, Peru.
20.19 	Paracas and Nasca figurines like these were created as nudes with minimal surface decoration. Like Inca votives such figurines may have been intended to be used clothed in small textiles, rather than nude. Both figurines are solid, unlike effigy vessels which are hollow. A) Unslipped Paracas Cavernas figurine with incised decoration on the face and emphasizing the pubic area and vaginal slit. Small breasts are applied to the chest (Drawn from photo of American Museum of Natural History accession #641.0/8484). B) Two views of a slipped Nasca 4 figurine, redrawn from Proulx 2006.
20.20 	Wari female figurine or effigy. This example lacks the well modeled attributes evident in some figurines, and is not depicted as nude. Instead she has a carefully painted dress with white underskirt and a decorated hem, belt and collar held in place by a set of three tupu pins. Similar to many Nasca and Paracas figurines, her face is decorated with ‘tear marks’, in this case executed in red slip. Like most votive figurines her arms are placidly placed across the chest/abdomen. Drawn from photo (Young-Sanchez 2004:153 figure 6.1, colors approximate).
20.21 	Photo of head of small ceramic figurine from the site of Iwawi, Bolivia. The fragment dates to the Tiwanaku period and was found in domestic contexts. Like female figurines from other contexts it has long, center-parted hair; traces of black slip/paint still remain. A possibly unique Tiwanaku trait may be the strongly emphasized chin which here protrudes past the nose. Original photo courtesy of the Iwawi Archaeological Project.
20.22 	Nasca vase with bands of female, “Betty Boop” faces. The female face motif is accompanied by chevrons in alternating bands of red, gray, brown, cream and yellow, a band of stylized triangular faces and a band of more abstract icons, possibly stylized trophy heads. From the collections of the Milwaukee Public Museum, author photo.
20.23 	Late Nasca face-neck jars depicting females, most in active poses. A) A woman in a dark dress carries a bundle of wood suspended from a tump line across her forehead and leading a white camelid, perhaps to a sacrificial offering (drawn from photo by Proulx 2006: plate 36, colors approximate); B) A woman in a white dress, red facial decoration and fish-scale markings on her arms rests with legs flexed while carrying two anthropomorphic figures (babies?) on her back (drawn from photo by Proulx 2006:, colors approximate); C) This example is less active than the others illustrated but wears a mantle with an elaborate depiction of a mythical creature(adapted and redrawn from Proulx 2004); D) This example displays strings of peppers or legume pods perhaps in the act of making an offering (drawn from photo of Arthur M. Sackler collection accession # N339, published by Katz 2004, colors approximate). 
20.24	Tiwanaku effigy jars show females in seated or kneeling poses in which hands and feet are often only implied by the modeled form. A) This is one of several jar fragments from Pariti found as part of a buried cache of ceramics, many of which represented females clothed in striped mantles and wearing a lobed headdress or elaborate hairdo. A small raised bump of clay on the right cheek, near the nose may represent a mole, suggesting that the vessel is a portrait of an actual person, not merely an idealized image. Drawn from photo by A. Korpisaari (Korpisaari and Parssinen 2005: photo 4). B) This vessel from Cochabamba depicts a sitting or kneeling female with one knee raised. Like the Pariti figure her mantle has a dark stripe at the hem and her hair is held in place by two large strips at the bottom of the braids. Drawn from black and white photo (Eisleb and Strelow 1980: plate 258). C) Another vessel from the Cochabamab region depicting a female figure in a striped mantle and perhaps a headdress. Drawn from black and white photo (Eisleb and Strelow 1980: plate 259). D) A vasija vessel form with a painted and modeled female face as the main element of decoration. Like other females her hair is parted to either side and she may have ‘tear marks’ on her cheeks. Like many effigies, the nose is modeled, but in a uniquely Tiwanaku twist, the chin is also modeled to give it prominence.
20.25 	Unslipped vessels can sometime be recognized as female. A) A globular vessel from Chen Chen sports long braids falling over her shoulders, like other Tiwanaku effigies, such as in Figure 24 above. The eyes and mouth are appliqués shaped like “coffee beans”. Drawn from photo (Owen and Goldstein 2002). B) A globular vessel in the La Ramada style clearly displays female sex characteristics – breasts and a vaginal slit. Incised lines under the eyes may represent “tear marks” like those often seen in depictions of Nasca females, see Figure 23 for examples. C) Other vessels in the La Ramada style are more ambiguous and lack clear markings of female gender or sex. The projections at the side of the face could be abstract renderings of braids and the aperture in the chest a misplaced vaginal opening, but it is difficult to say without contextual information, which this piece sadly lacks.
20.26 	An unslipped jar with “coffee bean” eyes from the Tiwanaku site of Iwawi. The eyes, nose and mouth depicted on the side of this vessel are clearly anthropomorphic and reminiscent of ones from Moquegua and Arequipa shown in Figure 25. It is difficult to identify the face as female, however. If vessel shape is significant, then it is important to note that this vessel is similar to the one with a more obvious female face illustrated in Figure 24D.
20.27 	Rooftop scene with three female figures prominently placed in the center of the ensemble. The female figures are flanked by four male figures, two on each side, each wearing a different type of head covering; one plays a drum. The scene may represent a feast or ceremony in which chicha is being served from several large jars. The largest of the figures is the central female; she wears a prominent collar or pendant and appears to be presiding over the activity flanked by her two female companions. The males appear only as auxiliary figures. Vessel is from Museo Nacional de Antropologia, Arqueologia, y Historia de Perú, registry # C-55264, after Proulx 2006: fig 5.118 and Tello 1959: fig 111.

23.2	Black-on-white effigy jar from the earliest known collection of Huarpa style ceramics. This vessel fragment and those in Figures 3 and 4 were found at Huari in cultural layers of occupational deposition exposed by a modern road cut west of the Capilla Pata building. Diameter = 12 cm. Collected by William H. Isbell, Katharina Schreiber and author in 1974. (Drawing by P. Knobloch)
23.3	Black-on-white effigy vessel, most likely a jar. Diameter = 21 cm. (Drawing by P. Knobloch)
23.4	Suggested reconstruction of large jar shape though the thick rim sherds were previously ascribed to large, “vertical sided open vessels” (Menzel 1964:9). The jar would have had two strap handles and, possibly, a modeled head located on or about the shoulder. A black-on-white checkerboard pattern was painted above the neck and black and white on brown hand-like motifs were painted below the neck. Diameter = 48 cm. (Drawing by P. Knobloch)
23.5	Schematic drawing of unit Eb4-2-200 excavated at Huari in 1977 by Dr. Isbell’s Huari Urban Prehistory Project. Initial excavation removed layers in a profile unit next to the road cut in order to expose and more clearly discern the layers that were then excavated in the 2 x 2 m unit. The lowest levels contained a Huarpa occupation with architectural features, followed by early Huari occupation of Epoch 1A with further wall construction, then general occupational deposition into Middle Horizon Epoch 1B. The area within the 2 x 2 m square above stratum 14 was badly disturbed and therefore analysis continued with data collected from the profile square.

23.9	Composite of two, effigy jar fragments from 1977 Conchopata offering excavation. The face on the neck depicts an individual assigned to the Agent 102 category who wears a chevron band headdress. Humped-animals face each other on the jar’s shoulder. On the jar’s body, a staff god stands on a pedestal with two rows of stylized profile attendants facing towards and away from this deity. (Photos by W. H. Isbell)
23.10	Profile of stratigraphy in the 1977 pipeline trench at Conchopata site. Units A and C were 2 x 2 m excavations to bedrock.
